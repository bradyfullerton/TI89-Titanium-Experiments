This is a series of programming experiments on the TI-89 Titanium calculator beginning with making the Matrix Rain effect in TI-Basic 89. 

Most people agree you should be using 68K assembly to get the best effect but I'm interested in starting in TI-Basic to see how far I can get around the limitations of TI-Basic.

I may end up coding this in 68K Assembly and/or C as well but honestly I'm mostly just enjoying the challenge and learning about different levels of programming code as well as how to solve problems within limitations.

Code should not be commented when placed on the calculator.
